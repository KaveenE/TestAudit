# Dummy Project for Lawndoc Repo Test

This repository contains a dummy project created specifically to test the correctness of the public repo called [lawndoc/github-leak-audit](https://github.com/lawndoc/github-leak-audit).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simulate a scenario where sensitive data might be accidentally leaked. By intentionally introducing a "leak", we can verify that the auditing tool correctly identifies and flags these incidents.
